#Tree Branching Assignment


###Part 1 - Creating the Trees

1. Create a branch called `pine`
2. Change to the `pine` branch
3. Add an `h4` with the text "Pine Tree!" to `index.html`
4. Add an image of a pine tree
5. Add and commit your changes and switch back to master
6. Make sure you switch to master, then repeat steps 1 - 5 for a Redwood tree instead of Pine
7. Make sure you switch to master, then repeat steps 1 - 5 for a Baobab tree instead of Pine

###Part 2 - Merging Branches

1. Go back to the master branch.
2. Merge in your `pine` branch
3. You my have conflicts.  We want to keep all images and `h4` tags.  Don't delete anything!
3. Merge in your `redwood` branch
4. Merge in your `baobab` branch
5. Your index.html should have 3 different `h4` tags and 3 different images

###Part 3 - Deploying
